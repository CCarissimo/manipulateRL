In this repository we explore the effects that recommender systems may have on users. This work is the code-base for a paper.

Users are modelled as Q-learning agents, with dynamic preferences, and engage in a multi-agent environment described by a Congestion game. The recommender systems are assumed to know the optimal (social welfare) solution and provide recommendations to the agents as state information.
